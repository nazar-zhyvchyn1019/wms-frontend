            <p>
              All shipping transactions in Extensiv Order Manager are recorded under our <b>Shipments</b> module. This is where
              you can print your <b>UPS End of Day</b> form. We keep records of your shipping information for 30 days, so you can
              reprint your <b>End of Day</b> form for any of those days, if required.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, for your convenience, you may choose <b>NOT</b> to print the <b>End of Day</b> form anymore since Extensiv
              Order Manager transmits all the shipping information for your packages directly to UPS when you print your shipping
              labels. The package icon at the bottom right-hand corner of each UPS shipping label that you print indicates that
              the package has been pre-scanned and that the <b>End of the Day</b> form as well as the <b>Package Level Detail</b>
              has been transmitted to UPS.
            </p>
            <p>
              If a UPS driver asks for the <b>End of Day</b> form, tell them that Extensiv Order Manager sends the shipping
              information directly to UPS when it prints your shipping labels.
