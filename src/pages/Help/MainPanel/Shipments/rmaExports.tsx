                If none exist already, set up an export configuration for the RMA export. You can create as many settings as you
                like, and you can delete them if you no longer need them. If you already have an export configuration option you
                want to use, please skip to Step 4.

            <p>
              To create a new export configuration, click the <b>Configure Settings</b> button.

              First, name your settings in the <b>Settings Name</b> field. Then choose which <b>File Format</b> you want your
              export file to be in from the CSV, Excel, and Text options. You can also change the <b>Date Format</b> you want to

              On the right-hand side, you can choose whether or not you want the text in the <b>Column Name</b> column to populate
              the first row of your export through the <b>Export Fields (Include column headers?)</b> checkbox.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, select from the <b>Add Field</b> dropdown menu each field that you want to export RMA data on.

                An acceptable configuration will look like the example above. Compare it to the example below - Row 3 here will
                cause your settings to fail when saved, as the enter key was not hit and it is still in editing format.
