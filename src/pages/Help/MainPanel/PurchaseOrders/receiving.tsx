              Once your warehouse (or 3PL) receives product from your vendor, it is important to record the receipt of the
              Purchase Order so that inventory value and/or inventory count is updated in Extensiv Order Manager. The below steps
              will outline how to receive a Purchase Order in Extensiv Order Manager
            </p>

                Important Note: Please be careful when receiving inventory from a Purchase Order in Extensiv Order Manager as P.O.

                Navigate to the <b>Purchasing</b> Module

              </li>
              <li>
                The "Receiving" functionality only applies to P.O.s in <b>Pending Delivery or Partially Delivered</b> status.
                Select either of these to display warehouses that contain Purchase Orders that are eligible to be received
                against.

              </li>
              <li>
                Select the Purchase Order that you wish to receive inventory for into Extensiv Order Manager and then select{' '}
                <b>Receive</b> from the top menu.
                <br />
                <img src="https://static.helpjuice.com/helpjuice_production/uploads/upload/image/12985/direct/Screen%2BShot%2B2021-01-21%2Bat%2B8.23.14%2BPM.png" />
              </li>
              <li>
                You will be prompted with the Bulk Receive PO window below. The "Apply To All" fields at the top will allow you to
                populate information that is that same among all purchase order lines, so that you only have to enter it once.
                <br />

                <br />
                If the <b> Update Inventory</b> checkbox is selected, Extensiv Order Manager will update inventory counts in the
                inventory module for the products that are being received. This is recommended to be selected if you are receiving
                inventory into an In-House warehouse. The <b> Update Inventory</b> checkbox is recommended to be un-selected if
                you are receiving inventory into a 3PL, since majority of the time the 3PL will be updating inventory counts into
                Extensiv Order Manager.
                <br />
                The <b>Receive</b> checkbox is a way to receive multiple P.O. lines at once but not receive all lines on the
                Purchase Order. If the receive option is selected, that specific P.O. line will be received. If the receive option
                is deselected that specific P.O. line will not be received against.
              </li>
              <li>
                You may also enter the necessary information on a P.O. line by line basis. Ensure all date information is entered
                into the the fields highlighted below.
                <br />

              </li>
              <li>
                Next, you will want to review and ensure all pricing and quantity amounts are accurate. <br />

                  description="Aggregate Costs for a PO (found in the Details tab of a PO) are automatically factored into the final Inventory Value for stock when it is received via PO. The Aggregate Costs for a purchase order do NOT include Discounts. If you want the Inventory Value FIFO Queue to reflect any applicable discount, then that discount needs to be manually included in the final cost for each line item. That means you will need to physically edit the Landed Cost field for every line item that has a discount on a PO from its current value to one that incorporates the price of the line item with the Discount applied. If you do not physically edit the Landed Cost value for a line item, then it will simply be calculated using the default calculation."

                Lastly, select the receiving stock location from the drop down menu. Only "Receivable" stock locations for that
                specific product in the receiving warehouse will populate in the dropdown. At this point you'll want to verify if{' '}
                <b>Update Inventory</b> is to be selected or not. Refer to step 4 for more information on the Update Inventory and
                Receive fields.

                If you have not already created a receivable stock location, you can select the âž• icon next to the drop-down menu
                to create a new stock location. If you wish for the location to only be receivable, you can deselect the "Is
                Pickable" option. Once created, select Save.
