            <h1>Customers Module</h1>
            <p>With Extensiv Order Manager's <b>Customer</b> module, you do not need to maintain a separate and expensive customer relationship management system. The <b>Customer</b> module allows you to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p>Add customers, and, if needed, attach them to a company and/or sales channel</p></li>
              <li><p>Add emails, shipping addresses, and telephone numbers to a customer's record</p></li>
              <li><p>Merge two separate customer records into one</p></li>
              <li><p>Track customer orders</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The <b>Customer</b> module has a search/filter panel on the left, the main customer record in the middle, the customer's details on the right, and the customer orders at the bottom. You have to select a customer record first before the customer's details and order record is displayed onscreen.</p>
            <p>Selecting any customer will display all orders related to that customer in the "Customer Orders" pane at the bottom, as well as the emails and addresses associated with this customer in the Customer pane on the right</p>

            <h1>Merge multiple Customers</h1>
            <p>If you have 2 different aliases for a customer (ex. John and John Peak in the screenshot below) you can select <b>Merge</b> from the top menu to combine these. Click <b>Merge</b> and drag the customer you wish to be the "Master" which has the most up to date address and email, and then select each customer you would like to merge into the Master. Once complete, select Merge at the bottom</p>
