              As Extensiv Order Manager understands your product types, we are able to calculate your inventory quantity, order
              information, analytics, etc. based on their available input.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are three types of products in Extensiv Order Manager: Core Products, Bundles/Kits, and Product Variations.
              When creating or editing products in Extensiv Order Manager, you can choose between two methods: manual creation in
              the UI or{' '}

            <h2>Vendor Products</h2>
            <p>
              Adding vendor SKUs in Extensiv Order Manager is necessary especially because it will serve as the foundation for
              your profitability within analytics, although this is not the only way to calculate profitability. Your COGS within
              Extensiv Order Manager is calculated by either your vendor products or the UI (refer to images). The one thing you
              cannot do in Extensiv Order Manager without having vendor SKUs is create purchase orders
